# SriLanka-Wildfire-Risk-Prediction
This project predicts wildfire risk in Sri Lanka using NASA MODIS satellite data from 2019-2023. Machine learning models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting were used to make heatmaps showing high-risk areas, helping early warnings and better wildfire management.
